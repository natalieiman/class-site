    <h1>The Art and Design of Crochet</h1>
    <h2>History</h2>
      <p> The origin of crochet is actually quite vague in comparison with other forms of handwork crafts."According to American crochet expert and world traveler Annie Potter, "The modem art of true crochet as we know it today was developed during the 16th century. It became known as 'crochet lace' in France and 'chain lace' in England." And, she tells us, in 1916 Walter Edmund Roth visited descendants of the Guiana Indians and found examples of true crochet." </p>

    <h2>Types</h2>
      <p> There are many different types or stitches of crochet that will create different patterns, thicknesses, and densities...</p>

    <h2>My Work</h2>
      <p> My relationship with crochet started as a quarantine hobby. I have always been someone who enjoys working with their hands, so this was a good mindless activity that passed the time. However, it has truly become more than just a quarantine hobby--It is something I do every day to take a break from screens, to calm/ground myself, and it has also sparked within me a very serious interest in textiles. Below are some photos of things that I have created so far</p>

    <h2>My Interests</h2>
      <p> Going forward, I definitely want to incorporate more textiles and hand-knit/crocheted things into my design practice. I use pinterest pretty often, and I have compiled an extensive list of inspiration that I hope to delve into in the neear future.</p>
